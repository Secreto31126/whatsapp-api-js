### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:

-   [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.
-   [ ] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.
-   [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.

### Tests

-   [ ] Run the tests with `npm run test` and lint the project with `npm run lint` and `npm run prettier`
