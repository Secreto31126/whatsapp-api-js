/**
 * @module errors
 *
 * @description
 * This module contains the custom errors that are thrown by the

 *
 * I did my best to explain why each error happens, include examples,
 * a few tips, and links to sources for further reading.
 *
 * This file is 300 lines of docs and the remaining is the actual code.
 * So yeah, enjoy reading :]
